# Crystal Collector Game

Deployed version: https://alla-akiyeva.github.io/Crystal-Collector-Game/

This app is a game built with jQuery.  

#### Here's how the app works:

* There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

* This amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
Once a crystal is clicked, the player's score counter is updated.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts without reloading the page whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The user's score is reset to zero.

* The game will show the total number of wins and loses. 

#### Built With

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
